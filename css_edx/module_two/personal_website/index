        Hi my name is Mark. I live in Austin, Texas and recently graduated from UT Austin with an MIS degree <br>
        I work for a financial technology company as a systems analyst. <br>
        Music is my favorite thing. I also enjoy running, and soccer. <br>
        I'm here to get better at designing web projects end-to end.
